# PROJECT no.4 - CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker (No Cloud Needed)
Github Repo: 
```bash
https://github.com/CSD-FX/GitHub-Actions-Docker-No_Cloud_Setup.git
```
This project focuses on establishing a robust, vendor-agnostic Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker, specifically engineered for a "No Cloud" environment. The projectâ€™s core achievement is its capability to run a full CI/CD process without mandatory reliance on proprietary, cloud-specific services (such as AWS CodeBuild or Azure Container Registry). This emphasis ensures maximum portability and control over the entire build infrastructure.
